C++ Variables:
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers with devimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes.
bool - stores values with two states: true or false

Declaring/Creating Variables:
type variableName = value;

Display Variables:
the cout object is used together with the << operator to display Variables.
to combine both text and a variable, separate them with the << operator
Example:
int myAge = 35;
cout << "I am " << myAge << "years old.";

To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;

Constants:
When you do not want others (or yourself) to override existing variable values, use the const keyword (this will
declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
Example:
const int myNum = 15;

C++ User input:
cin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator >>
Example:
int x;
cout << "Type a number: "; //type a number and press enter
cin >> x; //get user input from keyboard
cout << "Your number is: " << x; //display the input value
